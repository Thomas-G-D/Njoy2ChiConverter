MATXSR tapes are output files generated by running NJOY. These files contained cross section information
in a structured format that can be easily read by a post-processing program
This specific output is for Fe56 and was generated using NJOY21 
The document below walks through the different 'cards' contained in the file and explains the entries

The line below is one of the first lines in the code, it gives information about
how the output was generated and the materials used. 
it includes the hollerith file name (matxs)
the hollderith user identification (fe56)
and the double precision parameter (1 indiciation it is a single word for fe56)
-- 0v   matxs *fe56            *     1
 
The line above is followed by the output of the first 'card' signified by 1d
the first card gives information about the number of particles for which group structures are given (1),
the number of data types present (2),
the number of words in setting the hollerith identification record (18) [NOT SURE WHAT THIS IS], 
the number of materials (1),
the maximum size for entries on a sub block (5000)
the number of sub-blocks (106) [I beleive this is from the first 8d entry to the last 9d entry
-- 1d        1     2    18     1  5000   106

The second card displays user input hollderith identifications
-- 2d

--Processed by NJOY21                                                     

The third card contains information about the type of data contained in the file 
there is the hollerith identification of the particles used (n)
the hollerith names of the data types (nscat, ntherm)
the hollderith identification of the material (fe56)
the number of energy groups for the particle (172)
the incident particle associated with the data type 1 (1 indicating neutrons) 
the incident particle associated with the data type 2 (1 indicating neutrons) 
the outgoing particle associated with the data type 1 (1 indicating neutrons) 
the outgoing particle associated with the data type 2 (1 indicating neutrons) 
the number of submatierals for material i (2, one submaterial is used for each data type)
NOTE: a submaterial is added for each data type or group structure change
the location of the material (0 indicating info for this material starts at the 0th block) [I beleive the first 8d block is the 0th block]
-- 3d     n       nscat   ntherm  fe56

 [rest of block removed for brevity]
 
The 5th data card gives information about the isotope used for each data type 
the hollerith material identifier (fe56)

In the 7th card, the data is contained corresponding to the vectors identified in the most recent 6d card
the data goes vector by vector, working from the first identified group to the last identified group 
(i.e. for nwt0, start with the highest energy group and work to the lowest,
for ninel, start with the highest and work down 22 groups including the starting group)

 [the rest of this block was deleted for brevity]
 
The 8th data card is for matrices 
the first line indicates the hollerith identifier (nelas)
the first entry in the block of numbers indicates the number of orders (8)
the second value is the number of groups with a constant spectrum (0) [Not sure what this is]
the next 172 values (or however many energy groups there are) correspond to the bandwith for group i
the last 172 values correspond to the lowest energy group for the band of group i
Let us walk through this card. We have 8 orders and 0 groups with constant spectrum
then we move to the next value, 1. This says that for the highest energy group, there will only be
one transfer, looking at the corresponding 'lowerst energy group in the band' we see that the value is one, or that
the lowest group is the highest energy group, thus the only transfer is from the highest group to the highest group.
For the next entry, we see there will be two transfers for the second highest energy group; the next corresponding structure value tells us that the 
lowest energy group in this band is 2 (or the second highest energy group). Thus, for the second highest group,
there will be a transfer from the highest group and a transfer from the second highest group).

We interpret the 9d card based on the info in the previous 8d card. Recall there was only
one transfer for the highest energy group from the highest energy group. Thus the first
8 entries represnt the P0, P1, ... P8 coefficients for that transfer in that order.
Next, we look at the values for the second highest energy group. For this group, there are two transfers:
one from the highest group an one from the second highest. These entries will now move in band order
working from the lowest energy group transfer to the highest. I.E. there is the P0 entry for the transfer for the 
second highest group to itself, and then the P0 entry for the highest group to the second highest group, then the 
P1 entry for the second highest group to itself, then the P1 entry for the highest group to the second highest and so on.

This process is repeated for 43 matrices (as seen on card 5), thus completing the entries
for the first data type. I have removed these entries to keep this file compact.

Then, the entries for the second data type appear
This will follow the same format for the previous 6d card
the first entry indicates the starting energy group (92 with group 1 as the highest)
and the second entry is the last energy group (172, the lowest)
-- 6d     free    
    92   172
    
This card then starts with the entry for the highest group and continues to the lowest

We then have the matrix cards for the second data type with the same format as above
note that many of the groups have a value of 0 now. an entry of 0 for the first entry means
there is a band width of 0 for that energy group (i.e. no transfer information exists). This is
also matched by a 0 for the second entry.

Note that the 0's above indicate that no entry appears for that energy group.
Thus, the first values below correspond to the first energy group with a non-zero band width
note that entries in the block below can be 0, but those correspond to coefficients for a transfer
that still exists. I.e. the P0 and P1 bands may be non-zero while all the other bands are 0.
if any of the transfers (P0 through P7) exist, an entry needs to appear for each one, so
0s will appear in that case.
